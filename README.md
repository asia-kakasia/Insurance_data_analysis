Project Description
Insurance Dataset Analysis and Regression
This project involves analyzing an insurance dataset to understand and predict insurance charges based on various factors such as age, BMI, number of children, and smoking status. The analysis includes:

Data Loading and Exploration

Load the dataset from a CSV file.
Display the first few rows and summary statistics of the dataset.
Data Visualization

Create various types of visualizations to understand the data better.
Histograms to visualize the distribution of numerical features.
Box Plots to detect outliers and visualize the distribution of charges across different categories.
Pair Plots to explore relationships between features.
Regression Analysis

Simple Linear Regression: Analyze the relationship between a single predictor (e.g., age) and insurance charges.
Multiple Linear Regression: Use multiple predictors (age, BMI, children) to model insurance charges.
Polynomial Regression: Model non-linear relationships between predictors (e.g., BMI) and insurance charges.
Regularization (Ridge Regression): Apply Ridge regression to prevent overfitting and evaluate model performance.
Model Evaluation

Calculate and display Mean Squared Error (MSE) to assess the accuracy of the regression models.
Plot predictions against actual values to visualize the model performance.
